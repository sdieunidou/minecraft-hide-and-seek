## Server Installation
* To start, you have to install the server on a machine. Being a partner of [MTX-Serv](https://mtxserv.com/fr/hebergeur-serveur-minecraft), and mainly doing the server for them, I therefore advise you to take a server from them and install it in 1 click in the "plugin pack" section in the server panel. If you choose this path, you can go to the [next section](https://github.com/sdieunidou/minecraft-hide-and-seek#server-characteristics)

* You can still download the files yourself using the button as shown in the image below:

You then need to De-Zip the folder (via [Winrar](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=10) for example).
The folder does not contain a start.bat in order to start the server on your computer, you can easily find one on the internet. You will need a start.sh which is easily found on the internet to put it on a vps for example.

## Server characteristics

The server has several features:
* a `/stats` command
* a spectator system
* an object to make sound
* a map with hiding spots

## Server Configuration
To configure the server, you need to change a few files. It can be scary like that, but you'll see, it's simple!

Go to the file `plugins`> `Skript`> `scripts`

You will find many files in `.sk`, so you can change them as you wish. Change all `site` or `Serveur` to the name of your server.

Here is the **MANDATORY** list of `.sk` to be adapted:
you will have to modify all the `Serveur` mentions by the name of your server
* `plugins / Skript / scripts / main.sk`
* `plugins / Skript / scripts / cache.sk`
* `plugins / Skript / scripts / Lecalc.sk`
* `plugins / Skript / scripts / AzHack.sk`

Now you have to go to the configuration of the plugins

**DON'T TOUCH the server.properties except the MOTD**

## End
You've figured out how the server works, so have fun!
